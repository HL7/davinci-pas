# 06 Variance Request from CGP for the profiles that are not derived from US Core - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-42953
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on ServiceRequest derive from one of the base US profiles%

# 07 Reference to draft or deprecated items - also a temporary PAS code system was defined that will be reviewed later.
The resource status 'draft' and the standards status 'trial-use' may not be consistent and should be reviewed
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pas/CodeSystem/PASTempCodes%
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/task-status|4.0.1
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-minValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/remittance-outcome|4.0.1

# 08 For the given identifier slices the pattern will apply to all repeats
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 10 Our subscription notification example intentionally does not have narratives
Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management (text.`div`.exists())' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# 11 US Core is using type pattern and we are inheriting this in our snapshots
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# 12 These versions are before we started including Jira references in the change log and there's little value in going back to document them now
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title Version = 2.0.0
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title Version = 2.0.1

# 13 These versions are before we started detailed tracking of changes and there's little value in going back to document them now
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 1.2.0-ballot
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 1.2.0
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 1.1.0
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 1.0.0
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changelog.html) does not include an h3 section for the version 0.1.0

# 14 The SubscriptionTopic is not found in FHIR R4.  We are using it from the Subscription Backport R4 IG
DA VINCI: The How to Read page (background.html) needs to include a reference to the http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/subscriptiontopic.html because this IG uses the subscriptiontopic resource.

# 2.2-01 We are following the recommended way of identifying an X12 TRN identifier.
No definition could be found for URL value 'urn:trnorg:9012345678'

# 2.2-02 The three versions of US Core that we depend on (3.1.0, 6.1.0, and 7.0.0) are all cited in regulation.  A future version of the PAS guide may use 8.0.0 if it is cited in regulation.
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#7.0.0 released on 2024-05-08, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.1. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 2.2-03 We can confirm that the profile complies with 3.1.1 and/or 6.1.0
The validator cannot confirm that this profile complies with the claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-encounter|3.1.1'
The validator cannot confirm that this profile complies with the claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-encounter|6.1.0'
The validator cannot confirm that this profile complies with the claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-medicationrequest|6.1.0'

# 2.2-04 With new pinning rules, US Core artifacts are pinned to v7.0.0
Pinned the version of %

# 2.2-05 The US Core Organization profile marks the identifier as must-support but then has two slices that are not.
The slice 'CLIA' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The slice 'NAIC' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true

# 2.2-06 The US Core DocumentReference profile marks the category as must-support but the uscore slice is not.
The slice 'uscore' on path 'DocumentReference.category' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true

# 2.2-08 Pin-Canonicals is set but doesn't seem to be working for all cases
There are multiple different potential matches for the url%

# 2.2-09 Using the only published of the r4 Subscriptions backport IG
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 but package hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4#1.1.0 is based on FHIR version 4.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
This IG is version 4.0.1, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4' is from version 4.0.0

# 2.2-10 This is a value that the Publisher uses but does not appear to be defined yet
No definition could be found for URL value 'http://hl7.org/fhir/tools/StructureDefinition/expansion-parameters'

# 2.2-11 There is a "rogue" DTR package with a version of 3.0.1 that should not exist
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.davinci-dtr#2.1.0 released on 2024-12-21, but the most recent appropriate version is 3.0.1. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 2.2-12 The requirements and actor definition resources are only used for the conformance statements and are not needed for implementing the specification.
DA VINCI: The How to Read page (background.html) needs to include a reference to the http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/actordefinition.html because this IG uses the actordefinition resource.

# 2.2-13 We are using this to indicate an abstract term in our code system
The property 'abstract' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it

# 2.2-14 Parameters used for new features in the template
Unknown Parameters: [requirements-category-vs=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pas/ValueSet/cs-categories, term-params-in-artifacts=true, toggle-changes=true]
