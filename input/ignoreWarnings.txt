Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Repeating element with a pattern
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# Experimental value set warnings from the core FHIR specification
The definition for the element 'ClaimResponse.payeeType' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/payeetype' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental
The definition for the element 'ClaimResponse.fundsReserve' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/fundsreserve' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental
The definition for the element 'ClaimResponse.formCode' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/forms' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental
The definition for the element 'Claim.fundsReserve' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/fundsreserve' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental
The definition for the element 'Claim.payee.type' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/payeetype' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental

# We want this link to be version-agnostic
The link 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pas' for "Prior Authorization Support (PAS)" is a canonical link and is therefore unsafe with regard to versions

# No narrative in resource warnings
Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# New warning that requires an update to SUSHI around slicing
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
