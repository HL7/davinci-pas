The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 contains the following three major provisions:
* Portability
* Medicaid Integrity Program/Fraud and Abuse
* Administrative Simplification

This page summarizes the administrative simplification provision that implemented standard transaction and code sets, identifiers, security, and privacy rules across the healthcare industry.  This page is informative and implementers should always consult the full regulations if they have questions/concerns.

### Administrative Simplification Requirements of HIPAA
The major requirements of administrative simplification affect:
* Transactions and code sets - establishes standards for electronic transactions and external medical data code sets
* Identifiers - establishes a standard for a unique employer identifier and a standard for National Provider Identifiers (NPIs)
* Security - specifies the administrative, technical, and physical requirements for covered entities to use in safeguarding protected health information
* Privacy - establishes a set of national standards for the protection of certain health information; addresses standards for the use and disclosure of individuals' health information (called "protected health information"); outlines standards for individuals' privacy rights, as well as individuals' rights to understand and control how their health information is used

The complete suite of [HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/combined-regulation-text/index.html) can be found on the Health and Human Services (HHS) website at hhs.gov.

The following entities are affected by the HIPAA administration simplification requirements:
* All health plans, including Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial plans
* Healthcare Providers who choose to transmit any information in an electronic form in connection with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard
* Healthcare clearinghouses

Health Plans (including CMS) 
* May not refuse to conduct a standard transaction

>>> (2) A health plan may not delay or reject a transaction, or attempt to adversely affect the other entity or the transaction, because the transaction is a standard transaction.
>>> (3) A health plan may not reject a standard transaction on the basis that it contains data elements not needed or used by the health plan (for example, coordination of benefits information).
>>> (4) A health plan may not offer an incentive for a health care provider to conduct a transaction covered by this part as a transaction described under the exception provided for in § 162.923(b).
>>> (5) A health plan that operates as a health care clearinghouse, or requires an entity to use a health care clearinghouse to receive, process, or transmit a standard transaction may not charge fees or costs in excess of the fees or costs for normal telecommunications that the entity incurs when it directly transmits, or receives, a standard transaction to, or from, a health plan.

>> (c) Code sets. A health plan must meet each of the following requirements:
>>> (1) Accept and promptly process any standard transaction that contains codes that are valid, as provided in subpart J of this part.
